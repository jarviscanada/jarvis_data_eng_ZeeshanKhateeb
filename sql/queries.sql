    SELECT membercost * 1.1
    FROM cd.facilities
    WHERE facid = 0

  )
WHERE facid = 1;

--Question 1 : Control which rows are retrieved 

SELECT
  facid,
  name,
  membercost,
  monthlymaintenance
FROM
  cd.facilities
WHERE
  membercost > 0
  AND membercost < monthlymaintenance / 50;

--Question 2 : Basic string searches

SELECT
  facid,
  name,
  membercost,
  guestcost,
  initialoutlay,
  monthlymaintenance
FROM
  cd.facilities
WHERE
  name LIKE '%Tennis%';

--Question 3 : Matching against multiple possible values

SELECT
  facid,
  name,
  membercost,
  guestcost,
  initialoutlay,
  monthlymaintenance
FROM
  cd.facilities
WHERE
  facid IN (1, 5);

-- Question 4 : Working with dates

SELECT
  memid,
  surname,
  firstname,
  joindate
FROM
  cd.members
WHERE
  joindate >= '2012-09-01';

-- Question 5 : Combining results from multiple queries

SELECT
  surname
FROM
  cd.members

UNION

SELECT
   name
FROM
   cd.facilities;
